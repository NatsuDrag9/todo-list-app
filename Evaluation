Khalid:
Evaluating Parameters (on a scale of 10 for each):
1.) TDD approach (Score - 8)
The design doesn't clearly indicate whether this app follows a TDD approach. I know that this is an ambiguous point so I gave the score based on tests

2.) Clean code -- linting, variable names, readability, project structure (Score - 5)
Remarks: Readability
Separate different categories of tests (initial, tests that use apis, functionalities, etc.) in todo.test.tsx file
Remove code that is to be ignored from the file -- last test in the todo.test.tsx file
Recommended to move "render(<Todo />)" to beforeEachin todo.test.tsx file
Recommended to place all state declaration initially in the component
Recommended to minimize usage of data-testid as it's a selector intended for testing [1].

Variable Names
All good

Linting errors 
Type is missing for parameters in getUniqueValues, handleStatusChange, handleTagChange

Project Structure
Remove files (todocompleted.tsx) that are to be ignored from the repo (ignored for scoring)
Recommended to move the api to a json file for better project structure in todo.tsx

3.) Test coverage (Score- NA)
No provision to check test coverage

4.) Implementation -- full functionality and CSS (Score- 6)
Remarks:
Application works overall
No styling
Filter feature does not filter tasks that have a particular tag and are pending

5.) Test quality -- how effective is the test in capturing requirements, edge cases (Score- 7)
Remarks:
Initial rendering -- (done)
A task with any tag can be pending. No test for filtering pending tasks. -- (not done)
Testing api response from server -- (not done)
Liked the test for disabling/enabling buttons based on application state -- (good and done)
Navigation and its dependence on pagination -- (done)
Pagination functionality i.e. testing whether a page displays only 3 tasks -- (not done)

Total score - 26 + NA

[1] Chatgpt: Use data-testid for Testing Only: If your primary goal is to create selectors specifically for testing purposes and you want minimal interference with styling or semantics, data-testid might be a good choice.

Use roles for Accessibility and Testing: If you are aiming for a balance between accessibility and testing, using ARIA roles that provide semantic meaning and also serve as test selectors can be a good approach.
